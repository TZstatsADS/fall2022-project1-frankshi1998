+ Project summary: [a short summary] Capitalism is defined as an economic system in which a country’s trade, industry, and profits are controlled only by private companies. The United States and most of the nations around the world are capitalist countries, but capitalism is not the only economic system available. Communism, on the other hand, advocating that goods are owned in common and are available to all as needed, means of production are owned communally.
